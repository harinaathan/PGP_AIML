<p>This project uses the most popular classification techniques to predict the outcomes after extensively working on EDA treating missing values and imbalanced data. This project has two parts.<br> 
Part 1-Predicting the condition of the patient depending on the received test results on biomechanics features of the patients according to their current conditions.<br>
Part 2-Build an AIML model to perform focused marketing by predicting the potential customers who will convert using the historical database.</p>
