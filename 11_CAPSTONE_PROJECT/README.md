<h4 class="project-title">Deep Learning Based Car Identification</h4>
<p>
Computer vision based Object detection models specialise in identifying object(s) of interest in the field-of-view for real time applications. 
An object detection model should be able to localise and classify the detected objects.
Such models are frequently created by combining approaches from traditional machine learning algorithms and artificial neural networks.
Popular techniques include CNN &amp; R-CNN architectures, Â which have a track record of success in SOTA models.<br>
This study presents a CNN that learns both object localisation and classification simultaneously.
