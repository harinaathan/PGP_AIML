<p>The project was accomplished by employing supervised learning, ensemble modelling and unsupervised learning techniques to build and train a prediction model to identify the Pass/Fail yield of a particular process entity for a semiconductor manufacturing company. This project helps to determine key factors contributing to yield excursions downstream in the process and will enable an increase in process throughput, decreased time to learning and reduce the per-unit production costs.</p>
