<p>The project was accomplished by delivering 2 sub-projects.<br>
Part 1 deploys a neural network to build a regressor &amp; classifier respectively for a communications equipment manufacturer. The model predicts the equipment’s signal quality using various parameters from its products, which is responsible for emitting informative signals.<br>
Part 2 delivers an image classifier, which can classify numbers from the photographs captured at street level using a Neural Network”</p>
